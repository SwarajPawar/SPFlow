Lung-cancer Staging
Consider the case of a patient with a known
non-small-cell carcinoma of the lung. The primary
tumor is 1 cm in diameter; a chest x-ray examination
suggests that the tumor does not abut the chest
wall or mediastinum. Additional workup reveals no
evidence of distance metastases. The preferred
treatment in such a situation is thoracotomy, followed
by lobectomy or pneumonectomy, depending
on whether the primary tumor has metastasized to
the hilar lymph nodes.
Of fundamental importance in the decision to perform
thoracotomy is the likelihood of mediastinal
metastases. If mediastinal metastases are known to
be present, most clinicians would deem thoracotomy
to be contraindicated: thoracotomy subjects
the patient ‘to a risk of death but confers no health
benefit. (Some surgeons attempt to resect mediastinal
metastases that are ipsilateral to the primary tumor,
but this approach remains controversial.) If
mediastinal metastases are known to be absent, thoracotomy
offers a substantial survival advantage, so
long as the primary tumor has not metastasized to
distant organs. There are several diagnostic tests
available to assess any involvement of the mediastinum.
For this example, we shall focus on computed
tomography (CT) of the chest and mediastinoscopy.
Our problem involves three decisions. First, should
the patient undergo a CT scan? Second, given our 
decision about CT and any CT results obtained,
should the patient undergo mediastinoscopy? Third,
given the results of any tests that we have decided
to perform, should the patient undergo thoracotomy?
