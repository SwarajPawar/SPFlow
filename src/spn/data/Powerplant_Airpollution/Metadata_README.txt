DESCRIPTION OF DATA
===================

The problem, influenced by a problem in Probability Concepts in Electric Power Systems by George Anders, is that a power plant is presented with new air pollution regulations it must meet. There are three options to consider installing: new scrubbers, ordering new cleaner coal and constructing a new transmission line to a hydro plant with excess capacity. The company that would supply the new cleaner coal has a chance that the workers will go on strike. The utility company can decide whether or not to intervene resolving the situation but at an increased cost.
