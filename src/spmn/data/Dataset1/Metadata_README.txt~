DESCRIPTION OF DATA
===================

In this study a data set prepared by Reynolds and Lancaster (2007) for a small sized company is investigated in
detail. In their study, Reynolds and Lancaster (2007) examines the techniques used in making prospective
marketing estimations for small companies and they mention the utility of Bayesian decision making for these
estimations. For this purpose, they provide a decision problem cautioning that due to commercial worries,
original name of the company and name of the export country was changed. The company from which the data
gathered is a small textiles company that operates in The United Kingdom. The company produces carpets. The
currency involved is the English pound. A special type of carpet they produce is sold for a price of £32 per
square meter in the U.K. The product of the company is considered to fall into the category of luxury commerce
item in the United Arab Emirates and sold for a price of £56. Since the product is accepted to be a luxury item,
the prices are influenced by the state of economy in export country. The company management is expecting a
recession (decline) in the U.A.E. economy. It is stated by company authorities that the next 12 months are
important for the orders placed. There is an economical recession (decline) anticipation based on local inflation
and low commercial values. The company will export its product immediately or it will wait for another 6 or 12
month to do it. The executives of the carpet company foresee three different scenarios for the U.A.E. These are
stable economical conditions, slightly worse condition and severely bad conditions. The pay-off matrix for the
problem and probabilities assigned by the company authorities for economical state are given in Table 2. In each
cell are profit values that can be gained under various conditions of state of nature and decision alternatives are
displayed.
