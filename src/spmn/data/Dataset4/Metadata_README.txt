DESCRIPTION OF DATA
===================

Recent national guidelines recommend that
acute-care hospitals in which the prevalence of HIV
infection is 1% or higher offer voluntary HIV screening
to all patients.” To demonstrate the use of influence
diagrams with a problem of realistic complexity,
we evaluate the potential effectiveness of such a
screening program in a hospital with a prevalence
of HIV infection of 5%. We assume that the screening
test will be the sequence of antibody tests and confirmatory
Western blot typically used in HIV testing
in adults, rather than PCR as used in our previous
examples (table 2). The influence diagram models
two benefits from treatment: a benefit to the person
screened (from early medical therapy), and a benefit
to the sexual partners (from reduced transmission1
of patients who are identified as being infected with
HIV. We assume that early medical intervention, including
prophylaxis for opportunistic infections and
treatment with antiretroviral medication, extends
length of life by approximately a year, unadjusted for
quality of life.15,16 We assume that 80% of people
identified as having HIV infection reduce their
sexual contacts as a result of counseling; we assume
these people reduce their sexual contacts by 15%.
